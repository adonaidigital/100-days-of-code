# 100 Days Of Code - Log
My goal is to earn my responsive web design cerficate alongside with Js Algorithms and Data structures certificate.

### Day 1: January 3, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: worked on my product landing page in fcc.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

### Day 2: January 4, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to connect the nav-links to different sections of the page.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with making my embedded video pass the test and unable to figure out why my form is not passing the test too, but I'm glad at the progress made.

### Day 3: January 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Product landing page(project 3: Responsive web design) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** My page is not fully responsive yet thought it passed all fcc test, I need to perfect my responsive design skills before advancing to the next project; I have two more to go to earn my certificate.

### Day 4: January 6, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: I started the fourth fcc Responsive web design project(Technical documentation page), I implemented the basic html features.

**Thoughts**: Emmet saved me a lot of time, I wonder why I hadn't been using it but I'm glad I did. I'm still pondering on how to replicate the side bar with the nav-links.

### Day 6: January 8, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: worked on my Technical documentation page in fcc, passed 15/16 test of the project requirement.

### Day 10: January 13, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Working on freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript section.

### Day 14: January 17, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: still working on ES6

**Thoughts:** fcc Js part seems to mix advance and fundamentals in the same section of their course making some of the exercises difficult to tackle. You must be well advanced to do fcc project.
