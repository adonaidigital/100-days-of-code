# 100 Days Of Code - Log
My goal is to earn my responsive web design cerficate alongside with Js Algorithms and Data structures certificate.

### Day 1: January 3, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: worked on my product landing page in fcc.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

**Link to work:** [Product Landing Page](https://github.com/adonaidigital/fcc-product-landing-page/commit/07ec1c69be0728822ee23692b3e188a22dff063c)

### Day 2: January 4, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to connect the nav-links to different sections of the page.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with making my embedded video pass the test and unable to figure out why my form is not passing the test too, but I'm glad at the progress made.

### Day 3: January 5, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Product landing page(project 3: Responsive web design) on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** My page is not fully responsive yet thought it passed all fcc test, I need to perfect my responsive design skills before advancing to the next project; I have two more to go to earn my certificate.

### Day 4: January 6, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: I started the fourth fcc Responsive web design project(Technical documentation page), I implemented the basic html features.

**Thoughts**: Emmet saved me a lot of time, I wonder why I hadn't been using it but I'm glad I did. I'm still pondering on how to replicate the side bar with the nav-links.

### Day 5: January 7, Monday 

**Today's Progress**: worked on my Technical documentation page in fcc, partially completed the css part.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

**Link to work:** [Technical Page](https://github.com/adonaidigital/fcc-technical-documentation-page/commit/774c1d9b937b0546db06a48a98533be4d6ef0df5)

### Day 6: January 8, Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: worked on my Technical documentation page in fcc, passed 15/16 test of the project requirement.

**Thoughts:** Seems Layout and CSS are two different things and each of them should be mastered as a modern web developer. I am yet to perfect my art of responsive design.

### Day 7: January 10, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Technical documentation page(project 4: Responsive web design) on FreeCodeCamp..

**Thoughts:** Layout and CSS are two different things. struggled to pass the last test but I persisted and  I am glad I did. I need more exercises to perfect my layout skills.

### Day 8: January 11, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: started my personal portfolio page(project 5: Responsive web design) on FreeCodeCamp..

**Thoughts:** I am already becoming a maestro at this craft. I need similar projects to reach a black-belt, though my confidence has been built and it cant be taken away.

### Day 9: January 12, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: almost done with my personal portfolio page(project 5: Responsive web design) on FreeCodeCamp.. 

**Thoughts:** I cant believe I passed 11/12 test without using fully utilizing the grid system. I am unable to figure out why the link is not passing the test.

### Day 10: January 13, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: Working on freeCodeCamp Basic JavaScript section.

### Day 14: January 17, Thursday 

**Today's Progress**: still working on ES6

**Thoughts:** fcc Js part seems to mix advance and fundamentals in the same section of their course making some of the exercises difficult to tackle. You must be well advanced to do fcc project.  
**Link to work:**[Course Ref](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6)

### Day 15: January 18, Friday 

**Today's Progress**: still working on ES6, did rest and spread operators, object destructuring...stuck on some of the exercises

**Thoughts:** I need to retain what I am learning for mastery sake. Not sure if compentency is being formed from fcc exercises that I'm doing, I've been thinking of launch school, but dont know the extent of their free tier.

### Day 25: January 30 Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: still on basic algorithm scripting.

**Thoughts:** I hope I would'nt exceed 90 days in getting my certificate but it seems there is a chasm of ignorance that should be bridged and whatever time spent learning for mastery is no waste, my certicate can be gotten at a later date.
